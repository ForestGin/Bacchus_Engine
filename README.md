### Game Objects

To create a new primitive shape head to the GameObject window and select any of the vailable 3D primitives. In the case of an FBX file just drag and drop it inside the screen(same goes for textures, but keep in mind that the GO should be selected first)

Each GO has an inspector panel in which you will see some useful information or play with the GO Transform, normals... etc

### Debug

To see and use the debug features(wireframe mode, depth, lightning...) go to Window, open the Settings window and then enter the Renderer. 

## Extra Functionalities

* Extra primitive shapes: Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Cubesphere, Cone.
* GO can modify position & scale
* Imgui personalization of the engine
* GO name can be changed
